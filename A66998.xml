            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt, your intreaty; I ſay yours, and why ſhould it not much prevaile with mee? for you have broke through many diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and yet you hold out ſtill. what cauſe then, that I ſhould not put my hand to that worke, whereto you have put both your ſhoulders?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have beene tugging in my</hi> Mill <hi>theſe twenty yeares; and becauſe not like a</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe <hi>in the old beaten track ſtill, I have found ſome counter-checks almoſt every weeke, and this hath beene caſt in my teeth by ſuch, who ſhould underſtand better;</hi> Why not the old old-way, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the beſt way? <hi>No, not alwaies, nay never in thoſe petty Schoole points. We may be wiſer then our Elders, and ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them too, elſe we are blind: we have an advantage above them, ſtanding (though they no Giants, nor we Pigmies) on their ſhoulders. I could ever well digeſt theſe diſcouragements, though it is but hard meat, for I knew I was right, and ſhould ſatisfie one day, for I had ſpent many dayes and nights too, in finding out a</hi> Method: <hi>I am ſure I have met with it, follow it as well as I can, that is as I am able. All this while, I have not granted</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:32115:7"/> 
                     <hi>this to be a</hi> New Method; <hi>It is as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, (ſo it will appeare in due place) as is the writing of the</hi> Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet we muſt heare ſometimes (it is good for us)</hi> This is not the way that I was led, and that way was better, for I could con my Grammar from top to toe, every word and letter. <hi>So</hi> Friar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>he could rime too as it happened: and ſo much almoſt could the</hi> Parat <hi>doe long before him; for that</hi> Animal <hi>could ſpeake Greeke, which I am ſure he underſtood not, no not a word, not a letter. We might all well agree at this point, for our ſcope is the Childs good, but we invert the order: wee differ onely in the handling of the bow, (that is a great difference, it turnes the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide downe) or as the</hi> Painter <hi>framed the Picture of a</hi> running Horſe <hi>very well, but he tooke it by the wrong end, ſo the feet were upward, a great defacing to the Picture, but quickly mended. Certaine it is we doe juſt ſo, wee begin with the Child at the wrong end, and wee proceed (if we may call it a proceeding) like a Wiardrawer,</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Invert the order againe, as he the Picture, and we are right.

And for this great end and purpoſe wee muſt looke through, and through the child; wee muſt well underſtand him, before he can underſtand us.

Hee may bee like your Quickſilver, quick, and fleeting; wee muſt labour to fixe him, and (if ſo wee can) then to make him flee; yet ſo, that he make no more haſte, then good ſpeed.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32115:23"/> of bread-corne, and what to doe with it now I cannot tell.</q> Alas poore man! I mention it here that we may conſider; if men will doe ſo for gaine, what will children doe for feare? I will tell you what: for I am ſure this generation is not better nor wiſer then their Fathers, I will tell you what wee did, when wee were led on in the dark; when our Maſter began at the wrong end, as was ſaid, when he ſhould at the <hi>top,</hi> the underſtanding, the crowne of a man; I will tell, I ſay, what we did; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all our excuſes, and they were, for the moſt part, lyes; we wiſhed our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter no good, none at all, neither going forth, nor returning home, nor lying down, nor riſing up: we wiſhed it might raine pouring downe, eſpecially all the morning, though the fruits of the earth lay in the ſuds, ſo wee might ſtay at home what cared we for that: we were content with ſore eyes, and kybed heeles, they were good commodities with us, but that they hindred our play; wee would wiſh our ſelves dead too, when wee had not learnt to live; and though we could not be ſick when we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32115:24"/> would, yet wee would faigne it pretty well, and finde a time to ſteale to the Cupboard (not diſcerned) for proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a cruſt againſt the next day, (when we did forecaſt trouble.) To a boy play &amp; a dry cruſt is good cheare. It is not fit to tel all, and this could not be ſpared. But why all this? what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy boyes thoſe! the blame was not ours, we were in the darke, and yet ſpurred on as the Drunkard doth his horſe, when he minds not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor ſees one ſtep of his way; wee have cleared it then, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be unfolded.</p>
                     <p>How is that? as wee doe let in light into our houſe, by the doores and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. An ignorant man lives, we ſay, like one in a darke houſe: he is a dark man: and darke let him be, if he will not take the paines to pluck downe the wooden window, thereby to let in ſo glorious a creature as light is, and ſo delightfull. God be thanked, the mans houſe hath windowes, let him ſet them open; ſo much light will come in whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee will or no, as will leave him without excuſe, though he may be in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32115:24"/> the darke for all that.</p>
                     <p>But touching the Child, our purpoſe is that he ſhal not ſtir one inch farther, then he carries his Torch or Lanthorne in his hand, that thereby the <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> may doe its office, and put to <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> to doe hers; and now we goe ſure, becauſe in order making no <hi>inverſion</hi> thereof, for that is to <hi>turne the picture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our endeavour ſhall bee to put the Child in a good forwardneſſe, before he knows where he began; he ſhall bee well entred, before he knowes how hee came into the way; hee ſhall doe his worke <hi>playing,</hi> and play <hi>working;</hi> hee ſhall ſeeme idle and think he is in ſport, when he is indeed ſerious, and beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. This is done, when the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is cleared by its owne light; when the Childs owne doore, which he thinks ſhut, is opened by a naturall key, of the childs owne framing, and uſing. It is, I ſay (for I would be cleare herein) thus done, when things are ſo ordered and explained, as that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> is made eaſie by receiving his light, and dependance from the <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codent.</hi>

                     <p>I cannot expreſſe the way in one word, and in our Tongue more plainly then in the <hi>Latine</hi> it is, there we call it <hi>precognition,</hi> which in more words, thus may be deſcribed. <q>It is an <hi>anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the underſtanding, that is, a ſtealing upon it, and catching of it, unfolding unto it, that the childe <hi>knowes not,</hi> by that <hi>medium</hi> or meanes he <hi>knew before;</hi> or, It is that whereby

                     <p>The Child hath <hi>Arithmetick</hi> too, what a jolly fellow is this? (I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert words of incouragement, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteth greatly the little thing) he can skill of Greek, hee can tell you how many fingers hee hath upon the one hand, then he can <hi>number</hi> I hope.</p>
                     <p>He can put the other five to them, and tell what all amounts to; then he can <hi>adde;</hi> he can <hi>take away</hi> the one hand, and tell you how many remaines: The beſt Accountant in the towne cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer more punctually; then wee will grant he can <hi>ſubſtract:</hi> yes &amp; more yet is his skil, for he can tel you what twice 5. is, ſo he can <hi>multiply;</hi> And ten to one, if theſe ten were ten Apples, he would <hi>divide</hi> them by 2. to each hand even parcels, and ſo keepe all for himſelfe: otherwiſe, and in ſuch caſes, hee careth not for <hi>diviſion,</hi> though he underſtands it for his uſe very well.</p>
                     <p>Poore Child! hee hath diſcovered himſelfe too far: for now his skill is ſo well knowne, hee muſt to Schoole to learne his <hi>Mother-tongue</hi> the very next Munday; And there we ſuppoſe hee is, where the Miſtreſſe helps to hold the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32115:36"/> book with one hand, and (if it be as I have ſeen) a little twigge in the other, which the childe markes very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as wee would have it doe the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>Here is a change now, and that will be pleaſing for ſome houres. The next weeke the childe will tell you when is the next <hi>Holy-day,</hi> for that is all hee heard at Church, and all he lookes for, he knowes where, for he findes it to be a <hi>red</hi> letter: And for the Schoole hee hath no minde to it; by his going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and returning thence, we perceive well enough, that no man loves a priſon worfe: never looks he to ſee a mery day, ſo long as he is pent up there. Why? becauſe the Schoole indeed is but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to his body; and no way is taken to enlarge his minde. What a coyle is there to make him pronounce falſe? and becauſe hee cannot readily doe ſo, for very nature teacheth otherwiſe, perhaps hee feeles the twigge too, and his ſenſe is ſo quick at that point, that he cannot reliſh the Schoole.</p>
                     <p>He heares alſo of <hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> What are they? <hi>Latine;</hi> poore
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32115:37"/> little <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> he cannot skill of that. Then hee muſt put theſe together, and ſpell, What is that? <hi>Greeke;</hi> indeed ſo it is to the childe, and to the Teacher too.</p>
                     <p>Certaine it is, the child underſtands more of his own tongue in one moneth from his <hi>Nurſe</hi> (after he can ſpeak arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culately) then he gains from a Schoole in three in any language; which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth of what force nature is, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when a little helpt by <hi>Art,</hi> and made mighty by <hi>uſe:</hi> The one and the other, even all three gives us great accommodation here: <hi>Nature</hi> gives us the <hi>precognition; Art, Skill</hi> to uſe it: <hi>Vſe</hi> makes it familiar.</p>
                     <p>It muſt not be expected here, that I ſhould give the <hi>precognition</hi> to every thing that I would have learnt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; that were a <hi>dead</hi> work; <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> will inſtruct much, and the very <hi>thing</hi> in hand. This I ſay again, we muſt make it a <hi>preparatory</hi> to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of every thing, ſo preventing the toyle of conceiving the ſame: And we muſt finde a precognition, or make it, as the great Commander ſaid, when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32115:37"/> his way was blockt up before him. And this nature ſhewes, that a <hi>vowell</hi> makes a ſound alone, perfect of it ſelfe; The <hi>Conſonant</hi> not without a <hi>Vowell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed of it ſelfe, but the very <hi>eſſay,</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> of the tongue, and no more.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>c, g,</hi> and <hi>t,</hi> might but know their power once, and keep it ever, <hi>u,</hi> and <hi>v,</hi> diſtinct in figure, but more in ſound; if I ſay it were obſerved, it would ſave us much trouble in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proceeding; ſo alſo if the <hi>ſyllable</hi> were diſtinctly framed according to the plaine rules for ſpelling, ſo pronounced, ſpecially the laſt letter. For the <hi>pauſes</hi> or ſtops, our <hi>breathing</hi> will help us there, but the obſervation thereof, is the chiefeſt part in good reading.</p>

                     <p>This was implied before, we will adde to it; The uſe of the pen is great, almoſt univerſall; It helps the little thing to judge of artificiall things; what <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is, what <hi>formes</hi> or <hi>faſhions</hi> are; and this helps not a little in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick part.

                     <p>Wee underſtand <hi>Platoes</hi> words now: <q>Before <hi>Scripture</hi> was found, men were better learned then ſince, becauſe they were forced to write in their

                     <p>I ſuppoſe now the Child is put to Schoole there to learne the Art of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which makes a wonderfull rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the reſt of learning.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould ſay a word to the writing Maſter, and though I have little hope he will make uſe thereof, yet he muſt heare it, for it is of much uſe to the Child, and as much concernes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

                     <p>The Maſter muſt looke to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his Schoole, which is ſo looſe, that though the Child thinks, now he is put thither, <hi>he is made,</hi> yet the great feare is, and ſo experience tels us, <hi>he is in a way to be marr'd;</hi> There hee ſees and heares Boyes of all <hi>ſizes,</hi> who know they have a <hi>patent</hi> there to prate and to bee rude, which corrupts the little <hi>Thing,</hi> we have now in hand, more then is imagined.</p>
                     <p>Should not a Maſter looke to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment above all? Yes, he cannot doubt of it, nor of this which followes. He muſt conſider well, what <hi>Copy</hi> hee ſets before the Child; his own <hi>example</hi> in point of behaviour muſt be ſtraight and exact, for the Child frames after that alſo, moſt of all, for there is life in it.

For as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> they were his two wings, whereby hee could flye up to Heaven, ſo ſetting free the impriſoned ignorant: The ſame may bee ſaid of

                        <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>writing,</hi> if the child hath purchaſed theſe two, he hath excellent faire wings, which (as his Maſter is able to help him) will cauſe him to towre up to the top of all learning. And yet for all our haſt wee muſt not skip nor leape, wee may attaine to the top in due ſeaſon; but we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our <hi>ſeaſon</hi> now, and begin at the bottome ſtaire; ſo wee are upon the Grammar, where our practiſe ſhall be very eaſie, and familiar to the Child, (for the labour is prevented already) and ſpeedy too, for wee muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he hath two wings, therefore hee can flie. But withal we muſt grant this, that the Reader, if he have forgot his grammar, (as certainly he hath, though in his younger yeares hee could ſay it over, and over, as perfectly, as count his fingers: A ſhort time and other imployments will quickly ſpoyle the memory of all that; but what were conveyed to the underſtanding by an orderly and naturall way, ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines and no more) ſuch an one I ſay, cannot goe along with the Child one foot of the way worth his labour: And

Laſtly, wee have not touched upon <hi>recreations</hi> all this while, yet they lie direct in our way, and they are as neceſſary in ſeaſon (and upon good choyſe of the Maſter) as the meat is. But at this point I had two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Firſt, that here the Child will carve liberally enough to himſelfe, <hi>(labor eſt inhibere)</hi> whatſoever he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, he will not neglect his play; and for his neglects otherwiſe, hee hath more excuſes in his little pate, then hee hath bookes in his butchet. I will not plead for him at this point, onely this I muſt ſay; The Child <hi>ſits too long,</hi> I do not ſay, <hi>at his</hi> booke, for that troubles him not; hee can ſit ſtill and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but he ſits keeping a poſture too long; and cuſtome will have it ſo, though it makes againſt the childs health, and cuſtome of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Therefore I ſay; obſerve we the old verſe ſo much out of uſe, <hi>Puerum nil niſi pura:</hi> and ſpare not, let him take as much play as he will, for then it is as we would have it, true recreation, <hi>play</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:32115:61"/> 
                        <hi>and profit both;</hi> and this very thing was my after-conſideration;</p>
                     <p>That, for the boyes ſake, I have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the intelligent Maſter, to excuſe the child, though he doe not give him rime the very next morning ſaying his part without booke: For I remember well, that was a tedious worke once to me, and of no benefit then nor ſince: but account it reaſonable enough, that he can his <hi>Declenſions,</hi> and <hi>Verbes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly well, giving ſuch an account of both every day, as that it may appeare hee takes all the rules of Engliſh and Latin Etymologie (the Latine ſupplies what the Engliſh doth want) along with him (for they containe all) and will evidence, That the boy is not led one inch further then his ſenſes (thoſe great intelligencers) ſhall give him through-paſſe to the underſtanding of the ſame (a mighty helpe to memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beſides delight to boote.) It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greateſt eaſe to the Scholar, and the Maſter, that I can thinke of, whereby to gratifie both; and ſo will hee ſay that ſhall take leaſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider throughly thereof.

                     <p>My undertaking was in the cloſe of the firſt part, to ennoble the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what I could; To ſinde it work ſutable to the dignity of ſo high and excellent a faculty. Surely we may ſay of it; it is the great <hi>Peripatetick</hi> of the World: So wide is its <hi>Range,</hi> and it hath its <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> its <hi>Scoutes,</hi> and <hi>Spies,</hi> which it can ſend forth to the very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth, the depth of the ſeas, and the higheſt of the Heavens alſo.

                     <p>We will take the advantage of the higher ground, and raiſe up the child to the <hi>Pinnacle,</hi> as was ſaid, and there look about us a little. It will learne us what uſe there is of <hi>Generalls</hi> to a child, little, or none at all, and then afterwards,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32115:70"/> haply, to lead the child more wiſely. Therefore thither we will riſe firſt in our imaginations, ſo we may, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <note place="margin">

                     <p>Note this for the clearing the way; That we make uſe of the <hi>Pinnacle,</hi> and our <hi>Imaginary</hi> there, as in a <hi>crowd,</hi> and preſſe of people we uſe <hi>Lictores,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atores,</hi> Sergeants, and Whifflers, <hi>ad ſummovendans turbam,</hi> to keepe off the thronging in of <hi>ſingulars.</hi> We muſt look upon things at the firſt, (though we over-look them) as he did upon his Army, in one lump and maſſe, as they were once altogether; For in a way ſo various, ſhould I have minced out things into <hi>particulars,</hi> they would have ſo crouded in upon us, that we ſhould have found our ſelves not in a <hi>way,</hi> but in a <hi>maze.</hi> So we will imploy our <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi> in the firſt place, which will quickly run over a large circuit, and let it take ſcope, and <hi>range</hi> where it will, we ſhall the better ſee what account it will give us at the laſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet that this travell of the minde

                        <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 8. 53.</note>, They knew <hi>ſhe was dead.</hi> What dead, and not dead? Yes, and yet a truth in both.

Our Lords words are true alſo, nay Truth it ſelfe, and Spirit too: <hi>She is not dead,</hi> not dead to Chriſt, who is the reſurrection and the life; the body is not dead to Him. When He ſhall ſay to the Priſoners, <hi>Goe forth,</hi> to them that are in darkneſſe, <hi>Shew your ſelves,</hi> then preſently ſhall the <hi>prey</hi> bee

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32115:96"/> changes, and more unconſtant then the Moone, who is taken with any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing; for at the beſt it is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſometimes longer, ſometimes ſhorter, and the minde being fixed on it, ſo variable, and changeable, muſt the minde be too; it muſt ebbe, and flow, riſe, and fall, being carried with the ſtreame, and current of humane things. This is not diſtinct enough.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe we then, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee a man, his houſe being in a flame, carrying out the old lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, baggage, ſtuffe, ſome contemptible traſh, but having a Cheſt of ſilver and gold in his Chamber, ſhould take no care about that; would we not judge ſuch a man to be very weak, and ſimple; ſuch another is hee, who mindes every thing more then his ſoule. Suppoſe againe, that wee ſhould ſee a Captain, or Commander gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enemy what he can, victualling his Camp, ſending him proviſion every way, doing all that could be done, to help his enemy to make him ſtrong; In the meane time, ſhould ſtarve up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and thoſe about him, expoſing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32115:97"/> himſelfe and them to the very fury of the Adverſary. We muſt needs think, ſuch a man hath a crackd brain, he is not his own man ſure.

                     </argument>
                     <p>VVEE have viewed <hi>Natures</hi> great work, rather the work of God actuating Nature: Now we muſt take a view alſo of ſome inferiour works of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> both, employed all about mans body: Take good notice then, run over the body again, and not with a careleſſe eye; obſerve well eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing about thee, from that which honours thy head, to that which covers thy heele. Thou wilt conſider then, what creatures, and how many, have and do continually contribute towards thy accommodation. That is the firſt Conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then again, How many like thy ſelfe, but perhaps much better, have been, and are employed dayly about
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32115:105"/> the adorning thy poore carcaſſe. Thus obſerve the workes of Art about thee. A child cannot conſider this: yet wee muſt informe him what we can. Where is the man, who thinkes hereof as hee ſhould, conſiderately? yet doe theſe things require our ſerious thoughts and we ſhall very much gaine upon a childs underſtanding hereby.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, what a retinue, how great a company hath this poore man, alwaies ready preſſed to doe him ſervice? The Sun, the common ſervant of the world, ſee with what ſpeed he comes, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his appointed time, that hee may not faile man of a minute. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderable, and demonſtrable too. <q>I have been curious (ſaid a great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">Bellar. de aſc. mentis p 111.</note> in his time, too great to thinke himſelfe <hi>nothing)</hi> in ſearching into this ſecret, how many miles, the Suns race is in a minute, and thus I found it demonſtrable. I obſerved the firſt <hi>pearing</hi> of the Sunne to my eye in its riſing, then preſently I began to reade the 37. Pſalme, before I had read the Pſalme the ſecond time, the Sun was up, ſo quick, and ſpeedy is the mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32115:106"/> of that mighty body,</q> and ſo for mans ſervice altogether, which reads him a great lecture, but of that anon. Come we lower; The <hi>Moone</hi> doth him ſervice too, who knowes how much, every man knowes a great deale. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yet, The <hi>Winds,</hi> and the <hi>raine,fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling His word,</hi> hearing the earth, that the earth may heare <hi>man.</hi> The Birds of the ayre they are at mans ſervice: The Beaſts of the earth they groane under the hard uſage of their <hi>Lord.</hi> Some ſweat and toyle at his worke, other yeild him cloth and meate both. The wide Sea alſo, the Creatures there they are not behind to doe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; what a thing is Man! All above, below, and about him, all to doe him ſervice. What an honour is this, how great an engagement too? that muſt be conſidered alſo. And who is ſo weake that cannot reaſon thus, If all theſe be for my ſervice, how reaſonable is it, that I ſhould ſerve my Creator, Him only, and according to his rule, with reverence and godly feare?</p>
                     <p>But a ſoft pace goes far, wee are too quick for the Child; if wee are ſo curt,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32115:106"/> and ſhort, wee ſhall doe him little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; I will then briefly cleare the firſt <hi>propoſition,</hi> 
                        <q>That all Creatures have, and doe continually contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mans accommodation;</q> then, I will helpe him to make Concluſions thence ſerving much for our uſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Sun-beame is not more cleare upon the wall, then, That all Creatures are for mans uſe, All ſerve him: So God their great Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, I cannot expreſſe it more fully and briefly, then in the Fathers words; <q>O man, what hath God given unto <note place="margin">Chryſ. Tom. 1. Hom. 57.</note> thee? nay rather ſay, what hath He not given thee? Hee hath given the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the <hi>Moone,</hi> all the Quire of <hi>Stars:</hi> Hee hath diffuſed the <hi>Ayre</hi> which encompaſſeth thee; He hath ſtretched the <hi>earth</hi> under us, the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> above us, the <hi>Sea</hi> about us, Hee hath given Mountaines, Hils, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, Rivers, fruitfull lands, fruitfull ſeaſons, All greene things, all good things. In a word, All wee behold with the eye, all we reach unto with the hand, all wee tread on with the foot.</q> We have all, ſo bountifull a Lord
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32115:107"/> have wee; It is cleared to our ſenſe, that wee live upon mercy, <hi>doles</hi> of mercy, every moment of time; now the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions will be as cleare.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, (though it is no good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but fitteſt for the Child) let us give the Creatures their due, then their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Wee have them to <hi>uſe,</hi> wee muſt take heed we <hi>abuſe</hi> them not: if ſo wee doe, they will abuſe us, they will Lord it over their Lords, and make their Lords ſlaves, ſo revenging theit Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors quarrell. This appeares in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of meat, and drinke, which being ſurfeited upon, will caſt their Lord ſometimes into the water, ſometimes into the fire; And (to paſſe over grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="a" place="margin">Holy war B. 3. c. 16. p. 135.</note> miſchiefes, which our eye have ſeene, and our eare have heard) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times layes him along in the ſtreets, to bee gazed upon as a baſe <hi>ſlave</hi> to that Creature, over which a little before he was Lord. If wee thinke hereon, wee have enough to conclude therefrom, the ſober uſe of the Creatures; That we uſe them as not abuſing the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And now wee are upon a great and nice point, but I muſt breake from it,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32115:107"/> yet not ſo abruptly. I ſay it is a nice and tickliſh point, <q>to know the juſt bounds and limits how far we may goe in the uſe of lawfull <note n="a" place="margin">Childs Patrim. p. 80.</note> things, (for there is all the danger <note n="b" place="margin">

But Lord, Intemperance ſteales upon me; my meat and drinke, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all my watchfulneſſe, is my ſnare; I eate and I drinke ſometimes ſo as I feele I have ſtrengthened my
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32115:108"/> enemy and weakened my <hi>beſt friend,</hi> Lord forgive mee, Lord fortifie mee at this point. I ſaid it is a great point and a tickliſh one. An eaſie paſſage it is from the uſe to the abuſe of a thing;</q> there is but a ſtep, nay ſcarce an inch betweeene; and hence it is, that we fall foule by companies. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay a little to it. I will onely put a period to <hi>Auguſtins</hi> prayer, for it ſhould be ours, when the meat is before us, and kniſe in our hand, (the ſame in the uſe of all lawfull things) Lord make us watchfull now that we uſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to repaire, not to pamper Nature; that wee uſe them, not abuſing the ſame. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt uſe the Creatures mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully; They are commanded to ſerve us, wee muſt not make them ſerve in <hi>rigour;</hi> we muſt uſe them as Men that have bowels, wee muſt ſhew pity to our beaſt. There is no doubt of this. Wee are by ſpeciall indulgence Lords over the Creatures, a great honour; we muſt not bee Tyrants over them, an high point of injuſtice, and ſometime sevenged by the Creature it ſelfe; wee
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32115:108"/> have heard, and knowne, when a man hath beate his horſe ſo long, till the horſe beate out his Maſters braines. Then learne wee to uſe the poore beaſt mercifully, for if we doe not make him wild, a Child may lead him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And uſe it reverently too, even the leaſt bit of bread or drop of drink: what, uſe a bit of bread reverently? A Papiſt I beleeve. No, I doe not meane you ſhould adore a bit of bread; I hold it the greateſt preſumption in the World (and ſo our <hi>Juel</hi> ſaid before mee) to <hi>adore</hi> that which <hi>Longs</hi> wife can make. I ſaid we muſt uſe the bread reverently, and ſo I ſay againe, and it is concluded by the ſtrongeſt reaſon that can be: for it comes out of Gods hand into mine, and it is mine by free gift, and made a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of bread to me by a free mercy: but that is not all: The bread (I include all there) is not mine, for I am not mine owne, I am bought with a price, I muſt glorifie God with ail, and in all, then whether I eate or drinke, ſo I muſt glorifie God, but ſo I doe not, unleſſe I uſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reverently. But the chieſe reaſon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32115:109"/> is this; Theſe Creatures are a <hi>purchaſe</hi> too, nay the purchaſe of blood; wee had had no comfortable right to them, but in and through Chriſt. Wee were loſt, and we loſt the Creature too, Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, and gave us Title, and claim unto them; and all by blood. What? a purchaſe, and a purchaſe of blood? then we muſt uſe them reverently ſure enough, we are in the ſtrongeſt bonds that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And man muſt endeavour to be very good, ſo we have concluded too, All is good about him, very good, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth not give the Creatures their right, unleſſe he ſtrives to be good, very good; even better then they, for man is the very beſt, the moſt excellent of all. He muſt ſtrive to be excellent. For all his ſervants are good round about him; What a ſhame, what indignity this, that their Lord ſhould bee naught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all good things?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nor ought man to diminiſh any thing from the works of God, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I meane, thoſe that we think the leaſt of all, are very good all: they may differ in bulke and quantity, not in this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32115:109"/> prime quality. Wee muſt not ſpeake meanely, and below the dignity which belongs to the works of Gods hands, for this were to derogate from God Himſelfe. I think of <hi>Melancton</hi> now, his ſayings, and doings both were very exemplary. <q>Hee bade one that ſate next him, to taſte the wine as himſelf had done, and tell how he liked it, which his friend did, then told him; <hi>It was no bad wine.</hi>
                        </q> At which words <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Melancton</hi> was very angry, (in him paſſion quickly to ſhewed it ſelfe, but hee was more quick to ſhew his command over it) S. ſaid he, <hi>Good wine</hi> muſt have better commendations then ſo, you ſhould have ſaid, <hi>It is very good.</hi> And now it is very eaſie to apply. And I hope from henceforward, the child will ſay, <hi>Dry bread is good,</hi> and hard cheeſe, and meate <hi>very good,</hi> though there be no other ſawce, but what he carrieth with him in the tip of his tongue.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. One thing more while I think of it, for I am in ſuch a throng that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out; He that hath all good from Gods hands, wee will conclude him to be a mercifull man, a man that doth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32115:110"/> much good to others. What? hath God beſtowed richly upon any man? hath hee filled his hand and his mouth, and his coffers. and his barns with good things? And is this man a niggard? is he cloſe handed? like a fountaine ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up? doth he no good with all this good? The childe will cry <hi>ſhame upon him;</hi> For he hath concluded that ſuch a mans practiſe is againſt the voyce of the Creatures, and the Law of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>The childe ſhall heare again his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which is ſo freſh, being menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned but now. <hi>Melancton</hi> had plenty, as he called plenty; a houſe full of good things, and ſee how good he was to every one that needed. It is obſerved of him that he never denied a poore mans requeſt, if he ſpake ſupplications, then did <hi>Melanotons</hi> lips, and fingers ends drop mercy, like the firſt drops from a full hony-combe, that is the ſweeteſt <note n="a" place="margin">

Hath God ſo honoured him? The <hi>Sun</hi> for him, <hi>Moone</hi> for him, <hi>Ayre</hi> for him, &amp;c. for ſo I ſhould goe over all; All for him, how reaſonable a thing is it, that he ſhould be all for his God,

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Should now lead the childe from thence into the <hi>field:</hi> but we have been there already to my <hi>coſt,</hi> and we have been very circumſpect there, for we have viewed above, below, and round about us. No more remaines now, but that we return to the Temple againe, for there we were firſt; and there we will be laſt, for after we have viewed that ſacred place a little, we ſhall make towards a ſitting Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>To the Church then we goe, but we will not goe in. Thou ſhalt peep into it, thruſting in thy head or ſo, but no further, then as thou maiſt diſcerne
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32115:127"/> how neat, and coſtly all things are there, (ſo we ſuppoſe) no further ſhalt thou goe.</p>
                     <p>For me to preſent my ſelfe there, or to preſent thee there, is a matter of <hi>eoſt,</hi> a chargeable work, and properly the Parents. We muſt remember how it it was under the Law; The pooreſt came not to the Temple, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he brought according as his eſtate was, but the meaneſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>That is true, for that was a very <label type="milestone">

                     <p>It is indeed; God bleſſed for every, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> hath taken off that yoak. But yet now the ſhadow is gone, the ſubſtance is come, there is that, we may call <hi>coſt,</hi> remaining ſtill, what it is we ſhall know preſently: Curſed is he ſtill, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Lord with that which coſts him nothing; we cannot goe to a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, but it will coſt ſomething, and as the place is higher or lower, ſo muſt the coſt be: And think we then, the preſenting our ſelves before the Lord in His houſe, ſhall <hi>coſt</hi> us nothing? Who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32115:127"/> made us ſo familiar? as a great perſon ſaid to one, who was too bold with him. Look childe; behold the place well, goe round about it, look in, ſee the beauty of it. Why all this beauty? It is the houſe that God hath builded for the honour of His great Name, that it is. We muſt carry our ſelves reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently there. If thou doſt heare any laughing, talking, brawling there, or ſeeſt any more irreverent carriage, know, that ſo it ſhould not be, but a Chriſtian like deportment every where. Of two extreames we ſay not which is better, being both extreme naught: But certainly it is a more ſeemly, a more becomming ſight, even a devout and humble ſuperſlition, then a prophane and bold rudeneſſe, not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in a common houſe. This, as we ſaid, is Gods houſe. And yet thou muſt not conceive, that the earth, or ſtones, or wood there, ſuch materialls have any holineſſe in them, any at all: No, take heed of that vain thought. But in <hi>relation,</hi> and <hi>reference</hi> to the great things done there, the place is an holy place; Gods Name is called on there, Holy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32115:128"/> and Reverend is His Name. Tidings of great joy are heard there, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, that, by which we muſt be judged; by which we ſtand or fall at the laſt day; This is publiſhed there, and made knowne to the children of men. There the <hi>reproach</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is rolled away <note n="a" place="margin">Joſn. 5. 9.</note>: There the Lord Chriſt doth even now at this day, as great things as He did in the dayes of His fleſh; He healed the withered arme; opened the eyes that were ſhut; made the <hi>lame</hi> to goe; great things theſe: He doth the ſame things now: He by the miniſtry of His faithfull ſervants (He is the great Prophet) doth open mens eyes, doth turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 26. 13.</note>, &amp;c. Wonders no doubt! works for which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be admired. <note n="c" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 10.</note>. And can we think, we may come to Church (we may bring our bodies thither, ſo the beaſt doth too) preſent our ſelves there, ſee all theſe things done upon our ſouls, and be at no <hi>coſt?</hi> A bewitching, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooling thought this. Certain it is, we muſt <hi>remember</hi> the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> we muſt prepare for it, (as the ancient and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32115:128"/> cuſtome amongſt us did teach) we muſt retire our ſelves the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and they with us under our charge, we muſt <hi>ſanctifie</hi> our ſelves this night, uſing the meanes, the Lord hath appointed, and ſanctified: we muſt <hi>take paines</hi> with our heart, ſo aukward and untoward, (this is to be at <hi>coſt)</hi> if we look to ſee ſuch great things on the morrow; We muſt never forget, what <hi>Joſhuah</hi> ſpake, (we will fixe upon that Text a little, the Lord fixe it upon our hearts for ever: it will cleare unto us, that to <hi>morrow,</hi> if we doe any good at the Temple, we muſt be at ſome coſt to <hi>day)</hi> we muſt not, I ſay, forget what <hi>Joſhuah</hi> ſaid; we reade the <hi>context</hi> firſt. The Lord was about to doe great things before their eyes: His mighty Arme would make the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> ſtand upon heaps: the Prieſts to ſtand in the midſt thereof upon firme ground, as dry as the ſtone in the ſtreet, and ſome good while they ſhould ſtand (while the people paſſed over apace) with a wall of waters at their back, like vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men; this great work the people ſhould ſee the very next day; but yet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32115:129"/> ſee they might, and not ſee; ſee, and not perceive; ſee, and yet not lay it to heart, unleſſe they would be at <hi>coſt</hi> with themſelves, in all the meanes, and wayes of grace, and ſanctification: Therefore <hi>Joſhuah</hi> ſaid unto the people, <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves, for to morrow the Lord will doe wonders among you.</hi> This is the Text ſo notable. And the Lord write it in the tables of our hearts, and keep it as a ſure word there for ever; That we may ever remember it, and do according, when we expect the Lord ſhall doe great things in us, for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, as the turning <hi>Iordan</hi> back: The turning our hearts to Him, which is in its own way like <hi>Iordan</hi> when the banks were full: The making our feet <note place="margin">Joſh 3. 5.</note> ſtand firme in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when the waters of affliction are at the back, and threaten they will run over all; yet to ſtand like men of warre; yet to ſtand faſt, not yeelding an inch. When wee expect theſe great cures; theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull deliverances; theſe mighty works; theſe unſpeakable mercies, (call them what we will, ſo we have them) wrought for or upon our ſoules,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32115:129"/> in expectation thereof we ſhould come to Church) which are the opening our eyes, <q>The turning us from darkneſſe to light, from the power of Satan to God: The rolling away the reproach of Aegypt from off us:</q> when I ſay we expect all this, wee muſt remember <hi>Ioſhuahs</hi> Counſell, and practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves, for to morrow the Lord will doe wonders among you.</hi> This concernes us as much as it did the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old; if wee are not ſanctified for the worke, it is extraordinary, if wee receive good from the worke; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee muſt be at <hi>coſt</hi> with our ſelves, as the Scripture counts <hi>coſt,</hi> wee muſt take paines with our hearts, ſo plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our <hi>fallow ground:</hi> elſe to goe to Church is not worth our labour, for the ſeed there will fall amongſt thornes.</p>
                     <p>There was an old Ceremonie in uſe amongſt us, I will not compare it with the new, but I will ſay it was as <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> as that we call moſt harmeleſſe. The Ceremony was, <hi>To ſalt the Child at the Church doore.</hi> I hope I ſhall never dare to add or take away, to or from Gods <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> ſo much as one jot.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32115:130"/> But let me ſay, the <hi>Morall</hi> is good, and concernes all together. <hi>Every one ſhall be ſalted with fire, and every Sacrifice ſhall be ſalted with ſalt: Have ſalt in your ſelves</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And now my fingers are upon a great ſore, a Plague-ſore. I will lay it open, that we may ſee the blood, but all the ſalt in the pariſh will not cleanſe it out, but, <hi>had we ſalt in our ſelves,</hi> that would doe it. The Reader may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now what I meane, a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he ſhall know preſently, and the wonder will ceaſe, I ſhall tell him no more but what he knows, and every one will grant: I ſhall ſet downe the common obſervation, the ſame which he hath made, and which I have made ever ſince I was able to looke abroad, and make any obſervation, which I could doe 34. yeares agoe. I ſay I will ſet downe the obſervation of every man, who hath his eyes in his head, and can obſerve to purpoſe. Then wee ſhall heare ſome complaints, which the Reader ſhall beleeve too, if he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve his owne eares. When this is done, the foundations of all our woe,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:32115:131"/> and miſery will be diſcerned in point of manners, then let them come in for helpe, that will, and can. The obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That at your great Aſſemblies, where the people meet to ſerve their God, and expect to ſee thoſe great wonders (we ſpeak of) wrought there: the <hi>Servingmen</hi> for the moſt part, thoſe wicked and ſlothfull ſervants (do not pardon me, I offend not, nor have I a low eſteem of the meaneſt officer in a houſe, no, I honour him if hee bee faithfull) theſe Servingmen, fruitleſſe <hi>Creatures,</hi> very <hi>Cretians,</hi> come not to Church, or if they come they ſtay not: They come many of them, as <hi>Whifflers,</hi> to make roome for their Lords, and their <hi>Ladies,</hi> when that is done, their worke is done: out they goe, you may take them napping on their Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxe, or ſitting cloſe in a warmer place, with their cup at their noſe. This obſervation is common, is it not thus, even thus? Now wee muſt heare the complaint, there is no remedy. The <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi> both tell us, their <hi>Coach-man</hi> is a drunken, that is their Engliſh; hee brought them to their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32115:131"/> great friends houſe; In they went to the Parlour, the ſervant into the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; when they were to returne, there was no <hi>man,</hi> he was gone they found a Beaſt in his roome, for he was not his owne <hi>man,</hi> he could not be theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed up of Wine, and ſtrong drinke.</p>
                     <p>Doe wee wonder now? no ſure. It were a wonder if it be not ſo; a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they are not as plague ſoares in a houſe, firebrands there. For the ſervant went in with his Lord, and Lady, to the great mans houſe, and there hee ſate by it, till he could not well ſtand. But ſo he doth not doe, when he goes to Gods houſe, if he goes in, he goes out preſently; or ſuppoſe he ſtayes there; the polluted himſelf even then, or a lir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de before in the Cellar we ſpake of, and now if wee finde him at Church, you find him aſleepe there. Now he that hath an <hi>eare,</hi> let him heare; or an <hi>hand, let</hi> him come unto helpe; or <hi>bowels,</hi> let him make lamentations. And for us Governors (high and low, rich and poore, all fall foule here) are our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints right? can wee expect a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

That they ſhould bee wetted with the drops of Heavens raine, who came not to the place where the heavenly dew fell? or if they come, then place, and ſervice to be performed there, then the horſe hath which hee drives. <q>Remember this, and ſhew we our ſelves men, bring it to mind ô we tranſgreſſors:</q> And pity ſoules, our owne, and theirs, committed to our charge.

                     <p>This is of infinite concernment, let us conſider better of it.

That he ſhould walke in a way of obedience towards his Maſter on earth, who carrieth himſelfe preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly in a way of rebellion againſt his <hi>Maſter</hi> in Heaven?

                           <hi>A childe muſt not eſcape for his fault: A diſcreet Maſter that can judge thereof alwayes, and correct it thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sloth, how corrupting.

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN very good time, now we have <note place="margin">1 Part pag. 90. ſect. 13.</note> read our Lecture, and done with our leſſons, a we will keep Seſſions, but in our own Court. We will take the child to task for his negligence. I ſaid well <hi>negligence.</hi> Let the Maſter look to him, and the Parent by all meanes, he muſt not ſcape for his negligence, nor for his wilfulneſſe neither. But the Maſter muſt be carefull, and the Parent alſo, very circumſpect muſt they both be, that they may diſcerne well, that, we ſpake of, from <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> from <hi>frailty</hi> of nature, and <hi>invincible ignorance.</hi> A very hard matter it is to goe even there, turning no where, neither to the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32115:134"/> right hand, nor to the left.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter had need to carry his underſtanding alwaies in his hand, (ſo the wiſeſt Maſter cannot alwayes doe, he muſt doe what he can) that would puniſh a child alwayes for his fault. A fault it is not to miſſe again, and again, and yet a third time, nay a fourth, as the child may be taught; for he may be in a <hi>Maze,</hi> and no clue in his hand to lead him out. I am perſwaded in my conſcience, That if juſtice were done at this petty point, (ſo it is adjudged to be, but it is no ſmall point) the Maſter might ſuffer thrice for the childs once; for either he informes not the childe at all; or if he doe, it is the wrong way, and by the wrong end; or if any way, then be knocks him firſt, his hand go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before his tongue; or if together, (which ſhould never be) the hand is the quicker; a great wrong to the weake child. Certainly, we ſhould doe at this point, as the Judge of all the world doth, and He doth right: For ſpeaking after the manner of men, and to inſtruct our ignorance, <q>He came down to ſee firſt, whether the ſins were according
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32115:134"/> to the cry: A gracious God!</q> and then, if after long patience, He will thunder in His judgements, as certainly He will, yet behold Grace ſtill! Hee will <hi>lighten</hi> firſt, He will give warning, that certainly the clap is comming: He did ſo, if we marke the Context, even to thoſe Cities, I made reference to. But wee looke too high at ſo low a point, this is too high for us! No, I remember <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>

Is it a fault, ſloth, ſtubbornneſſe, &amp;c. which we are about to puniſh? It is: Yet ſtay the hand; not withſtanding we muſt not thunder yet, The childe ſhould ſmart in a leſſe terrifying way. But if we muſt ſpeak high, as if ſons of thunder, and clap hard
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:32115:135"/> too, for ſo the fault may require; yet we muſt be ſure, that we have <hi>lightned</hi> firſt, I meane, we have let a light into the childs underſtanding, and ſo ſet it up there, that he is convinced clearly, that he might have ſeene his way, and have walked by the light, but he would put it out, and the <hi>clap</hi> came, he knows now, how deſervedly. We muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefull at this point, for our pety actions now, teach for afterwards, and make great impreſſions that way. The child will tell you twenty yeares hence, <q>I remember what my Maſter did, how diſcreet he was, or the contrary; Our actions may be made <hi>preſidents,</hi> when we little think of it.</q> Therefore I ſay again, we muſt not doe, as that light Judge did, command execution now, and call a Jury for examination anon; God forbid; but it is as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous every whit to doe as many times we doe; <hi>Thunder</hi> firſt, and <hi>lighten</hi> after; and moſt croſſe it is to the way of heaven.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall never forget, for I felt it, That I ſuffered once, as ſometimes children doe, for my <hi>ingenuity.</hi> I mention it by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32115:136"/> way of <hi>caution,</hi> as there is need, for I do not think that any one twigge fell in vain, ſo much I honour the memory of my maſter: I had <hi>Iter</hi> in my way, and it was my lot to <hi>parſe</hi> it: A ſtammering boy I was, and making haſte fell ſhort a ſyllable; my Maſter was as ſhort with me, and up I went. Wiſe men have not alwayes their wits about them, nor their underſtanding at their fingers end. But this was the old Diſcipline; my judgement is utterly againſt it, but I think withall, in this lazy age, it would doe moſt good: of that anon. To our purpoſe, <hi>inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>correction</hi> muſt ſtill goe together; but in the ſame order ſtill, when the childe ſmarts he muſt learne too; (as was ſaid in due place <note n="a" place="margin">Childs Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Preface, p. 10. Book p. 27.</note>) I learned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by all my ſmart, unleſſe froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. A Maſter may teach that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; with the froward the child will be froward; that we remember well. I ſaw not my error, (a great hint to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe) nay to ſay the truth, errour there was none, for as the meaneſt Scholars know well, It argued more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, to give the word an increaſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32115:136"/> but of one ſyllable, then of two, for I was never told, that the old word was <hi>Itiner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay then, and it is an Oracle, if we would in all caſes let in the <hi>light</hi> firſt, it would ſave us the trouble of thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the poore childe would on apace, eaſed of that terrour, for it is all the trouble he yet feeles in the fleſh, as play is his chiefe joy.</p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly the Muſick-maſter takes a good way; when he would make the childe <hi>ſing,</hi> he will not make him <hi>cry,</hi> for then he knowes the <hi>Muſick</hi> is marred. It is ſo, if we would ſee it, in Grammar learning; when the childe ſtands <hi>quaking,</hi> and learnes <hi>crying;</hi> when hee ſpeaks <hi>prayers,</hi> and the Maſter <hi>threats,</hi> all this time is loſt, no good done, but hurt a great deale. Now the Proverb plucks the Maſter by the eare; <q>No man makes haſte to the Market, where nothing is to be bought, but blowes.</q> The ſumme is, we muſt goe gently, and very calmly on, not <hi>blowing</hi> at all, when we would ſet up a <hi>light</hi> in the underſtanding, which muſt firſt be done. A little puffe of winde blowes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32115:137"/> out all preſently. The <hi>light</hi> you ſet up in a childs underſtanding is, at firſt, as the candle you have newly lighted, and are gone with it, by that time you have gone three ſteps, the candle is out, for you were too haſty, and you did not (as the manner is) ſhelter it well from the winde, for the leaſt breath doth it. Now we have our leſſon, how to teach, and when to correct: we will take this one note with it. <q>Our natures, as well as our conſciences, are more moved with <hi>leading,</hi> then dragging, or drawing; and pety er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours will be better reclaimed with gentle meanes, rather then Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized with hard words, and blowes.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now I hope, the Child and I are very good friends: all this while, I have ſpoken to his heart, and to very good purpoſe. I have indeed, and I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heartily, as he that greatly tenders the Childs good. But yet for all this, hee, and I are not friends as hee calls friendſhip. and accounts the ſhews thereof. Certaine it is, I am as great an enemy to his negligence; as any one
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32115:137"/> in the Towne; and I have many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I muſt be ſo; For, for the moſt part, ſuch the negligence is, that it checks the Maſters paines every where: and it is ſo foſtered at home, for the moſt part, that the Parent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thinke, and thinke with reaſon; that the Child will prove for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either ſerviceable to himſelfe, or the place hee lives in. The Parent muſt thinke ſo as reaſon muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his thoughts, for by that <hi>level</hi> he muſt walke; and then hee takes the meanes along with him, conducting to the end. Then wee make judgment by the Parents practiſe in the breeding of the Child, That he looks for no more from him, then that he eate and drink and riſe up to play. We have diſciplin'd the Parents houſe already, but that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is loſt. And ſo is ours too, I ſpeake as all Teachers would ſpeak, our paines with the Child, for the moſt part, runs on, as ſome water doth, to <hi>wafte,</hi> and all becauſe the Child is not quickned betimes, and rouzed out of his lazy diſeaſe. Some hurt alſo the Maſter may doe the Childe, againſt his will;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:32115:138"/> hee may make the Child careleſſe by his over-much care, yet hee cannot abate an <hi>Ace</hi> of it. The diligent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, may make the Scholar negligent; nay, paſt all doubt, ſo it is.</p>
                     <p>It is the complaint of a learned Commentator on <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he was right, <q>If you ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to condeſcend to your Scholars <note place="margin">Hier.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Wee will gratifie them ſo farre now, as to grant this; <q>There were as good Scholars formerly as now, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps better too; for my part,</q> I verily beleeve it. There is an invincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. The <hi>old</hi> diſcipline is gone, nay that which was but 36. years agoe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:32115:139"/> we have it not now: The boy is grown idle and lazy, the Parent likes it well. But if the old diſcipline, which ſo croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nature, and a new method, which is (they will call it ſo, whether wee will or no, though) according to Nature, if theſe did meet, and cloſe each with other; then I know what would bee, wee ſhould have very good Scholars now: (though wee love not compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) much good would bee done in a little time, whereas little is done now in much time. I am ſure the Objection is anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Now the Parent may heare how he may be miſtaken, though he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Child to an honeſt able man; (hee muſt be both:) hee expects now his Child will thrive, and prove a good Scholar, and all very quickly, for he knowes his Childs abilities are good, and the Maſter faithfull, (hee hopes) what ſhould hinder, why his Childe ſhould not prove a good Man, and a good Scholar both together? A happy proceeding, <hi>Amen,</hi> God grant it prove ſo, even ſo, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt tell the Parent now, what
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:32115:139"/> blocks we finde in the way, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der progreſſe mightily; and if he will not put to both his ſhoulders for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of them, he will fall infinitely ſhort of what he hopes to ſee. But if he will joyne his hand to the work hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, walking by the <hi>level</hi> of right reaſon, and according to his <hi>rule,</hi> he may finde his hopes, and reap comfort, all in their ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt then, he muſt catechize his childe, drop inſtructions into him, <hi>whet</hi> them upon him, <hi>morning, noone,</hi> and <hi>night;</hi> that is the Scriptures <hi>Method,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 7.</note> and <hi>Rule.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>ſeaſons</hi> for our <hi>precognitions</hi> ſpoke of and explained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let that be markt. Now if thus the Parent doth not, what he poſſibly can doe; for, I ſay again, theſe are the <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> and one more, <hi>when</hi> he <hi>walketh by the way,</hi> let him beleeve me this once, a man of ſome experience here: <q>The thing will not be done;</q> when the time comes, it is more then a doubt, he will not finde his hope in his hand; If he abate ſo much as an inch of his proper duty and endeavour touching his childe, he muſt abate alſo, more
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32115:140"/> then an <hi>ace</hi> of his expectation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The boy (and girle too) hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a lazy, ſluggiſh humour; Let him doe what he will, he will doe juſt nothing, or as good as nothing. or worſe then nothing; he will be idle all the day long; and idleneſſe, we have heard what that will doe, rather what it will undoe. The Parent muſt purge out this bad humour what is poſſible, and the ſooner the better. Let the child rather pick ſticks, or gather wooll, then ſtand idle. If the Parent lookes not to this, and doth as hath been ſaid, I can aſſure him, the Maſter cannot, for he knowes it is vaine labour to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>check that, which is countenanced and foſtered at home.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter doth but his owne task, and that hath been compared long ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:32115:140"/> promotes exceedingly. But if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be in a Lethargy, (lazineſſe is ſuch a diſeaſe) then the Maſters may ſleep too, and doe as much good as talk to a lazy boy. I doe not ſay a <hi>dull</hi> boy, he never troubles me, he will doe well enough, for he mindes what he doth; I ſay a lazy boy; the boy muſt doe his endeavour, elſe we are at a ſtand. Why? it is the law of nature, man muſt put forth his endeavours, if he meanes to live; God gives us <hi>corn,</hi> we muſt make it <hi>bread;</hi> the <hi>grape,</hi> we muſt make it <hi>wine; wooll,</hi> we muſt make it <hi>cloth; wood</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> we muſt build the houſe. Still God ſheweth us by His works in nature, <q>That mans labour muſt concurre, and meet with His of Providence.</q> It is juſt ſo here betwixt the Maſter and the Scholar. But I am of the ſame minde I was, The more the Maſer doth, the leſſe the Scholar will doe, if after the common manner.

                     <p>The Commander ſaid well, <q>His men ſhould gain their drink by ſweat, and then it would be wine; and win their bread from the roots of trees,</q> and then it would be dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Nor did the old Father dote, when he told his ſon, <hi>He left him a treaſure hid in a field;</hi> the young man fell to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, &amp;c. but no treaſure all that while; yet by his good husbandry, he made the field very fruitfull, and that was the treaſure the Father meant. I ſay then,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:32115:141"/> and ſuch my judgement is, I ſay not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der correction <q>That the child profiteth moſt, there where he hath leſſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, more exerciſe, and moſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:</q> And I thank God that ſo it was with me; for thereby it comes to paſſe, God ordering it ſo, that I have been the more induſtrious ever ſince; And what a man gets by his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is ſure, and beſt pleaſeth as we heard. But yet, this I muſt ſay alſo; It is a way I ſhall never allow, for it is to make the childe to ſerve in <hi>rigour,</hi> (fit enough for his lazy nature, which will be taught no good, but by a bad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod) exacting the full tale of bricks, and allowing no ſtraw; requiring the task, and not making it poſſible, by ſhewing the way of performance. No; that is pety <hi>tyranny,</hi> or oppreſſion, no better. I would rather, if it might be, the child were led on with delight, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his candle in his hand, and then if he ſlumble as one in the dark, fetch him up as you doe your horſe, and let him feele the ſpurre in its place. And we ſhould doe prety well here, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline the childe well enough, with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32115:142"/> the Parents leave alſo, if the child were quickned at home: but there he is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go on ſo ſlack and lazy a pace, that he will not be put out of it by our ſpurre. Yet for all that, ſomething we muſt doe; elſe we ſhall undoe the childe quite, who is halfe undone already. The childe muſt know and feele too, (that is his knowledge) that there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part in the Schoole, nay in every place that is for inſtruction, one the Maſters, the other the Childes. And they muſt doe each their work mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, elſe there will be a vain work. The Maſter muſt ſpeak, the child muſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; The childe muſt ask, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt give him the hint of a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Maſter muſt anſwer calmly. And thus the leſſon goes on till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters work be done. And now the child ſets to his work preſently, for it is the opportunity of time, he muſt foreſlow no time, to recollect, to faſten that which was ſaid, to make in it a <hi>ſure word,</hi> his own for ever; The boy muſt uſe all diligence, that doth mighty things, elſe the Maſter labours in the fire, and ſo will the child too, if he be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32115:142"/> not well inſtructed withall, that the bleſſing is from heaven, a thing the childe heares little of, but it is all in all.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid before, <hi>till the Maſters work bee done;</hi> It is never done. Something in point of information, ſomething in point of reformation, about the child or himſelfe, findes him work ſtill. Let me ſay it once for all: The Maſter may learn much by teaching the childe; A great deale of good Divinity from that little thing, which is old Natures right. I know no ſuch looking glaſſe in the world, wherein to ſee the mans heart, as is the <hi>face</hi> of the child. Therefore I ſaid well, The Maſter hath ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe, either about himſelfe or the childe, and when he cannot make the childe better with all his care, then his care muſt be to make himſelfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then there is no loſt labour. The longeſt day is ſhort enough for this work; In the winter he muſt take the night too, and and all too little to doe a great deale of good in. which ſhould be his ambition.</p>
                     <p>The Maſters recreation muſt be with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32115:143"/> the childe, (he will make him merry ſometimes, ſo muſt he the childe, and then the work goes on) I have read and ſeen an old <hi>Grand-ſire</hi> ſporting with his young childe, ſo refreſhing his own ſpirits, and the childs both: Aſſuredly we may learn and teach both, no fitter way; for as (ſo I told you) the boy muſt be ſerious in his play, (we allow no time for calviſh mirth) ſo muſt the Maſter what poſſibly he can, <hi>play</hi> in his <hi>worke:</hi> he muſt doe it with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that may be; then it is no bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

As ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Grammar (for they are rules as was ſaid) make the quickeſt pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration into the underſtanding, ſo doth the example of the Maſter into the manners of the Diſciple; nay a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter penetration into the life, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is lively.

He muſt pray with the child, he muſt pray for the childe; he muſt heare for the childe, (the childe muſt heare from him again, all that is for his uſe) he muſt heare with the childe; He muſt be reverent in his carriage here and there and every where, then ſome hope there is, the child will prove good, and grave alſo in his ſeaſon, elſe none at all.</p>
                     <p>The Maſters converſation is a mould, into the faſhion of which the diſciple is caſt; then I ſaid very well a little before, (all the skill is to practiſe there after) <q>As the Maſter hath much work about
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:32115:144"/> the childe, ſo hath he as much and more about himſelfe, and this lieth betwixt his owne heart, and God.</q> I profeſſe heartily, I know not what wee can doe (no good ſure) unleſſe we have a continuall recourſe to heaven, and an influence thence.</p>
                     <p>No creature ſo hardly governed as man, ſo it was anciently concluded. I ſay alſo, it is the tendereſt work in the world, to deale with a childe. It is <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> man is naturally <hi>rough;</hi> the childe is like it ſelfe, <hi>ſlow,</hi> the man is <hi>quick;</hi> the childe is as <hi>weake</hi> as is imagined, very aukward to his buſineſſe; the mans paſſion is like himſelfe, <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and quickly breaks out at the mouth, and fingers end, and then he begins at the wrong end. So then, if we have not continall recourſe to heaven, we ſhall be out, and (as the expreſſion is very full) <hi>heavenly wide.</hi> We muſt then be much with God, that He may be ſtill with us, ſpecially then when we are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon inſtruction; for then we ſhall have matter for paſſion to work on; therefore we muſt remember our ſelves, ſo calming our ſpirits; for our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:32115:145"/> work hath an influence not into the child only, but into the whole Comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; great reaſon we ſhould impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune an influence from heaven. So then we are at our concluſion ſtill; A good Schoole-maſter muſt be as a good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, (I am ſo charitable, that I do not think there is a bad Biſhop in the world, for I mean really, and allow the name heartily; and doe beleeve verily, there are degrees amongſt men, as amongſt Angels; elſe where order ſhould bee, there confuſion will be; and I know this as wel as any thing elſe, That he is but a man, like an earthe veſſel, frail, &amp;c. weak) as a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who overſees himſelfe, there is the chiefe work, next his own houſe, then Gods houſe; and then he muſt be as his Predeceſſors have been, a man of another world, having his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven: ſuch a one a good <hi>Schoole-maſter</hi> muſt be, (how ever they ſtand in the circumference, they meet at this point) his <hi>converſation muſt bee in heaven,</hi> if he look to doe much good upon earth.
